# Workout_Tracker
Create a workout log to ensure that you are recording and charting your cardio and resistance training.

### Introduction:
This application utilizes mongoDB to ensure that we are logging all of the prevalent information on the back end. The front end has been previously provided, so we need to ensure that we are properly catagorizing and storing the information in the proper format in our database.
